This error occurs when using the `useRef` hook in React Native with a functional component. The component renders an image component using the ref to control its visibility using the `style` prop. However, the image might not render or update its visibility properly, leading to a blank screen or an image that doesn't change its visibility as expected. This might be because the ref object might not be fully initialized when it is accessed or because the state update is not triggering a re-render of the image component.
