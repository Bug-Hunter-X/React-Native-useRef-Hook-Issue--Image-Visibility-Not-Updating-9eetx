# React Native useRef Hook Issue: Image Visibility Not Updating

This repository demonstrates a bug related to the `useRef` hook in React Native when controlling the visibility of an image component within a functional component. The image may not render or update its visibility as expected.

## Bug Description
The issue occurs when a functional component uses `useRef` to manage an image component's visibility. Despite updating the style prop via the ref, the image's visibility remains unchanged, leading to incorrect rendering.

## Bug Reproduction
1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
3. Run `npx react-native run-android` or `npx react-native run-ios` to run the app.
4. Observe the behavior of the image; it should not change visibility correctly.

## Solution
The solution involves ensuring that the ref is correctly initialized and that the state update triggers a re-render of the image component. This is achieved by using `useEffect` to check for ref initialization and a state variable to force re-rendering.
